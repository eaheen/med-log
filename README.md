# Medical Info Tracker Journal #app (needs a name)

***Keeping track of outpatient care finally makes sense.***

A tracker for doctors, medications, medical records, allergies, symptoms, medical events, and more. Organize your medical information into categories. Journal about your overall health. Keep track of your doctors, clinics, and pharmacies. Never scramble for medical contact info ever again. Your data is encrypted and stored locally. Keep it all secured with a PIN, fingerprint lock, or password.

## Health Log (HL)

> *Note: This might need a rename.*

More than just journals. Keep track of all info related to a specific part of your health. View your Complete Health Log (CL) as a comprehensive timeline of your medical history. Create Categories for your areas of your health that have multiple facets. 

Add medical records, emails, phone numbers, pharmacies, and other information your doctor or clinic sends you.

### Doctors & Contacts

Keep track of all your doctors, emergency contacts, pharmacies, and other emails and phone numbers. No need to scramble for an email, hospital statment, or business card. No more struggling to remember which doctor you saw for what appointment or when.

### Symptoms & Illnesses

Come down with the flu? Sprain your ankle? Got your wisdom teeth removed? Create a HL and keep track of the symptoms, temporary prescriptions, any follow-up visits, and contact your doctors if necessary.

### Medications & Substances

Keep track of pickup and renewal dates, prescribers, pharmacies, dosages, amount left, effectiveness, and side effects. Never run out of your prescriptions again. Always know how much you need to take and when. Have an easy timeline of how a new medication is affecting you.

You can also track recreational substance use, so you have a more complete understanding of your overall health.

### Calendar

Keep track of appointments, how much medication you have left, and when you need to contact doctors or pharmacies for regular checkups.

Interfaces with Google, Apple, and Outlook so you can automatically add appointments to your calendar, or import an event to one of your Health Logs. If you add an appointment to your calendar app that contains a medical keyword such as "doctor", "clinic", or "therapy", #app will automatically prompt you next time you open it and ask if you want to add this event to one of your Health Logs.

### Share & Export

Export all or part of your CL or HL as a PDF or Word Document. You can choose exactly what you want to include; only share what you want to. 

Send it to your doctor or clinic ahead of your next appointment so they have a complete timeline of how you're doing.

Send it to your friends or family if they want to stay up to date.

## Example: Mental health.
You may have one or more medications that affect it, and more than one doctor you're working with. Keep track of your appointments and meds so you can stay on top of it.
* Create a "Mental Health" Category.
    * Record your thoughts, mood, and energy each day.
    * If you use psychoactive substances recreationally, record your usage.

## Ideas & Considerations

* Emergency button on top bar of app contains allergies, medications & substances, and emergency contact info.
* Make this cloud-based, so you can sync data across devices.
* Search the FDA drug database for information when adding medications.
    * For illicit substances, add harm prevention information and warn against any conflicting medications.
    * Add a search bar for ^ this so you can look up harm prevention information without having to add it to one of your HLs if you're not taking it but you want to help a friend.
    * Add an emergency response section in the case of an overdose or adverse reaction.

> *Note: There are plenty of apps that already exist to do this. I'm building this partly as an exercise in app development, and partly out of a desire for there to be an open-source app for this.* 

> *Note: I have tried my best to resist scope creep, so for now the plan is **only** to implement the features already listed as part of the app, and not just ideas.*

> *Note: I'm aware this app could exacerbate hypochondria, especially given the rise of hypchondria in general. After a considerable amount of time questioning whether or not I should make this app at all, it is my stance that the burden of combatting hypochondria falls on the individual.*
